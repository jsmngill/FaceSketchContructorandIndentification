# FaceSketchContructorandIndentification
In today's rapidly evolving world, the rise in crime rates presents a significant challenge for governments worldwide. Swiftly identifying and apprehending criminals is crucial to bolstering public trust in the justice system. This project aims to enhance law enforcement efforts by accelerating the crucial step of identifying suspects, making the entire process more efficient.

Face Sketch Constructor and Identity Attestation is a web application designed to revolutionize the way facial sketches are created and recognized. Traditionally, the process of waiting for an artist to manually draw a suspect's sketch has been time-consuming, potentially delaying justice. This application leverages cutting-edge deep learning algorithms, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and integrates cloud services like AWS's Amazon Rekognition to streamline this process.

With an intuitive interface, the application allows users to quickly construct facial sketches by selecting and arranging facial features from a comprehensive side panel. This panel includes a wide range of features, enabling the rapid creation of accurate sketches within minutes. Beyond sketch creation, the application also assists in retrieving actual photographs and corresponding details of suspects from a maintained database, further aiding investigations.

This innovative tool stands to be a valuable asset for law enforcement, enhancing the efficiency of suspect identification and ultimately contributing to a more effective justice system.
